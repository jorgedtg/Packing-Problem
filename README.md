# Simulated-Annealing
Simulated Annealing for the Packing Problem.

The project aimed to apply simulated annealing to solve the problem of packing disks of different sizes without
any overlaps. The objective was to find the optimal configuration that maximized the packing density, using the
simulated annealing algorithm to gradually converge to an optimal solution.

Image Processing Toolbox required.
